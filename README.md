## 👋 Hi, I’m Grant Winns

I fell in love with tech at 14, when I built my first gaming computer.

When I was a kid, I taught myself QBasic, by being curios with desire to figure things out.

That early experience taught me something important, all problems has a solution as long as you care enough to look, and keep looking.

That mindset is gold.

I ended up working at Apple, where I excelled.

Eventually, I lead Apple Core, a 3-day offsite for cultural training. I was teaching retail staff how to embody the company’s values, sell, and about the tech in 2009.

Apple was was about thinking differently and I love that philosophy.

But, here’s the thing…

They didn't make it easy to work ON the business.

I want to improve things, at scale, and they we're a well-oiled machine already.

So, at 20y/o old, I quit, and started my first company.

I work my butt off, failed, learned, and eventually built and sold that first business (acquired by a conglomerate).

That win gave me the fuel to launch more ventures, and before I knew it, I was running one of the fastest-growing brands in fashion and apparel, generating nine figures in revenue.

Sounds glamorous for sure? But selling it wasn’t.

That’s the part exited-founders don't tell you...

Success isn’t always fulfilling.

Scaling companies, building brands, and making money didn’t solve the deeper problems.

The people around me were struggling, I stuggled, too.

#### This is why I Care About Mental Health…

Life happnes. Big or small moments. 

Life happens, and mental toughness, fortitude, resilience can we learned.

Therapy offers real skills, that will level you up. 

I’ve seen it up close, brilliant people breaking down, high performers hitting walls, and friends struggling with things they didn’t know how to talk about.

I’ve been through it, too.

The issue is that "Traditional Therapy is really, like accually, broken.

It’s expensive, slow, and inaccessible to the people, when they need it most.

The system is designed for a few, not for everyone.

But the good news is that Technology can fix that!  

If we’re bold enough to try.

That’s why I'm builing Yuna.

You're a part of a real change.
