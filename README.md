👋 Hi, I’m Grant Winns

Founder and CEO of [Yuna Health](https://www.yuna.io)

🧠 Entrepreneur & Visionary: I’ve built multiple startups from scratch, with 4 successful exits. Now, I’m on a mission to revolutionize mental health by bringing therapy to your pocket through Yuna—an AI-powered therapy app.
🌎 Building a Global Impact: Mental health care is expensive, slow, and difficult to access for most. That’s why I created Yuna, a purpose-built AI solution making quality therapy accessible for everyone, anywhere, anytime.
🚀 Currently Learning:

I’m constantly exploring LLMs, AI-powered self-guided care models, biometric health insights, and scaling products globally. Yuna is my sandbox for pioneering the future of digital therapy.

💡 Looking to Collaborate On: I’m always on the lookout for highly-skilled backend engineers (Go preferred), AI enthusiasts, data scientists, and front-end wizards who want to build something meaningful. Together, we can change lives, grow at scale, and push the boundaries of what AI can do for mental health.

📫 How to Reach Me: DM me on LinkedIn or email me at grant@yuna.io. I’m quick to respond—love to chat about tech, mental health innovation, or new ideas.

⚡ Fun Fact: I’ve lived and worked remotely across the U.S., exploring wild adventures while chasing the dream of making the world happier and healthier, one user at a time. 🌊🏕️

Follow me and join Yuna’s mission! Let’s build the future of mental health together—an app that reaches tens of millions, makes therapy affordable, and scales organically through innovation.
