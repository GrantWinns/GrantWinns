## 👋 Hi, I’m Grant Winns

I didn’t just stumble into technology—I fell in love with it.

When I was a kid, I taught myself QBasic. No teachers, no courses—just curiosity and a desire to figure things out.

That early experience taught me something important: Every problem has a solution if you care enough to look for it.

That mindset took me places.

I ended up working at Apple, where I didn’t just do the job—I excelled in it.

Eventually, I was leading Apple Core, a 3-day offsite cultural training program, teaching retail staff how to embody the company’s values.

Apple wasn’t just about products—it was about thinking differently, and I lived that philosophy every day.

But here’s the thing…

Working inside a business never felt like my endgame. I needed more.

I wanted to work on the business.

So, at 20 years old, I quit my job and started my first company.

I hustled, failed, learned, and eventually built and sold that business (acquired by a conglomerate).

That small win gave me the fuel to launch more ventures, and before I knew it, I was running one of the fastest-growing brands in fashion and apparel, generating nine figures in revenue.

Sounds glamorous, right? It wasn’t.

That’s the part no one tells you—success isn’t always fulfilling.

Scaling companies, building brands, and making money didn’t solve the deeper problems I faced—or the challenges the people around me were struggling with.

#### I Care About Mental Health…

Burnout. Stress. Anxiety.

These aren’t buzzwords—they’re real.

I’ve seen it up close: brilliant people breaking down, high performers hitting walls, and friends struggling with things they didn’t know how to talk about.

I’ve been through it, too.

The worst part? Therapy is broken.

It’s expensive, slow, and inaccessible to the people who need it most.

The system is designed for a few, not for everyone.

But here’s the good news: Technology can fix this—if we’re bold enough to try.

That’s why I built Yuna.

Yuna isn’t just an app—it’s a new way to approach mental health.

This isn’t just a foundational model, a clever prompt, and a payment processor—that’s the easy part.

We’re using AI, biometric insights, and self-learning multi-agent systems to deliver affordable, accessible therapy to anyone, anywhere.

We’re not waiting for people to hit rock bottom—Yuna intervenes proactively, providing real-time support before issues escalate.

We’re building humanity’s next healing modality.

Our mission is simple: Democratize mental health care and change the way the world thinks about well-being.

And I’m not doing it alone—I’m looking for people who want to build something meaningful and world-changing.

If you’re reading this… I’m looking for you.

What I Do (and Don’t)

→ I Don’t Drink Alcohol. Not because I have to—but because clarity is a weapon, and I want my mind sharp.

→ I Don’t Waste Time on Social Media. Conversations matter. Focus matters. Endless scrolling? Not for me.

→ I Don’t Say Yes to Every Invitation. Weddings, birthdays, random events society expects us to attend—I skip them. My time goes to what fuels my soul, not what checks a box.

→ I Live for Bucket-List Adventures. Last one? Galloping on horseback in Africa, chasing zebras across the savannah. Life is too short to say yes to mediocrity.

#### My Philosophy

If you’re reading this, here’s what you need to know: Working with me means building something that matters.

I don’t settle for average. I believe big problems deserve bold solutions, and I surround myself with the smartest, most ambitious people in the world—people who believe they can actually change things.

At Yuna, we’re not interested in incremental improvements.

We’re designing the future of mental health. We’re building tools that millions will use to thrive, not just survive.

If you’ve ever felt like your talents were wasted on things that didn’t matter—here’s your chance to change that.

#### Why You Should Join Us

I’m not here to play small, and neither are you.

If you’re smart, driven, and ready to solve real problems, we should talk.

I want builders, thinkers, and doers on this journey—people who are ready to create something remarkable and make an impact.

If that’s you, stop waiting.

Reach out, and let’s build the future together. 🚀
