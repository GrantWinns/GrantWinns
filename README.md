ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Grant Winns

Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.yuna.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=profile_readme&utm_campaign=personal_branding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yuna Health</a>

Who I Am

I didnâ€™t just stumble into technologyâ€”I fell in love with it. When I was a kid, I taught myself QBasic. No teachers, no coursesâ€”just curiosity and a desire to figure things out. That early experience taught me something important: Every problem has a solution if you care enough to look for it.

That mindset took me places. I ended up working at Apple, where I didnâ€™t just do the jobâ€”I excelled in it. Eventually, I was leading Apple Core, a 3-day offsite cultural training program, teaching retail staff how to embody the companyâ€™s values. Apple wasnâ€™t just about productsâ€”it was about thinking differently, and I lived that philosophy every day.

But hereâ€™s the thing: working for someone else never felt like my endgame. I needed more. So, at 20 years old, I quit my job and started my first company. I hustled, failed, learned, and eventually found a way to build and sell that business. That small win gave me the fuel to launch more ventures, and before I knew it, I was running one of the biggest brands in fashion and apparel, generating nine-figure revenue. Sounds glamorous, right? It wasnâ€™t.

Thatâ€™s the part no one tells youâ€”success isnâ€™t always fulfilling. Scaling companies, building brands, and making money didnâ€™t solve the deeper problems I faced or the challenges people around me were struggling with.

Why I Care About Mental Health

Burnout. Stress. Anxiety. These arenâ€™t buzzwordsâ€”theyâ€™re real. Iâ€™ve seen it up close: brilliant people breaking down, high performers hitting walls, and friends struggling with things they didnâ€™t know how to talk about. Iâ€™ve been through it, too.

The worst part? Therapy is broken. Itâ€™s expensive, slow, and inaccessible to the people who need it most. The system is designed for a few, not for everyone. But hereâ€™s the good news: Technology can fix thisâ€”if weâ€™re bold enough to try.

Thatâ€™s why I built Yuna. Yuna isnâ€™t just an appâ€”itâ€™s a new way to approach mental health. Weâ€™re using AI, biometric insights, and multi-agent systems to deliver affordable, accessible therapy to anyone, anywhere. Weâ€™re not waiting for people to hit rock bottom; Yuna intervenes proactively, providing real-time support before issues escalate.

My mission is simple: Democratize mental health care and change the way the world thinks about well-being. And Iâ€™m not doing it aloneâ€”Iâ€™m looking for people who want to build something meaningful and world-changing.

What I Do (and Donâ€™t)

â†’ I Donâ€™t Drink Alcohol. Not because I have toâ€”but because clarity is a weapon, and I want my mind sharp.
â†’ I Donâ€™t Waste Time on Social Media. Conversations matter. Focus matters. Endless scrolling? Not for me.
â†’ I Donâ€™t Say Yes to Every Invitation. Weddings, birthdays, random events society expects us to attendâ€”I skip them. My time goes to what fuels my soul, not what checks a box.
â†’ I Live for Bucket-List Adventures. Last one? Galloping on horseback in Africa, chasing zebras across the savannah. Life is too short to say yes to mediocrity.

My Philosophy

If youâ€™re reading this, hereâ€™s what you need to know: Working with me means building something that matters. I donâ€™t settle for average. I believe big problems deserve bold solutions, and I surround myself with the smartest, most ambitious people in the worldâ€”people who believe they can actually change things.

At Yuna, weâ€™re not interested in incremental improvements. Weâ€™re designing the future of mental health. Weâ€™re building tools that millions will use to thrive, not just survive. If youâ€™ve ever felt like your talents were wasted on things that didnâ€™t matterâ€”hereâ€™s your chance to change that.

Why You Should Join Us

Iâ€™m not here to play small, and neither are you. If youâ€™re smart, driven, and ready to solve real problems, we should talk. I want builders, thinkers, and doers on this journeyâ€”people who are ready to create something remarkable and make an impact.

If thatâ€™s you, stop waiting.
Reach out, and letâ€™s build the future together. ðŸš€
